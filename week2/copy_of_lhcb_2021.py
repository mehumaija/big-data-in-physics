Welcome to Week 4!

We will be focussing in Particle Physics Analysis and detecting matter/antimatter assymetries in the production of certain types of particles. ![LHCb detector](https://www1b.physik.rwth-aachen.de/~schael/LHCb_files/LHCB%20PREVIEW-white-bg.jpg)

The data we are using comes from LHCb - one of the experiments at LHC. It is a highly specialised detector aimed at detecting decays involving the B-quark. Unlike the other major experiments, LHCb detects particles very close to the source and looks almost exclusively in the forward direction - this gives the detector many advantages compared to other experiments at LHC.

In order to get started, we need to access the [ROOT framework](https://root.cern.ch/) and download some datafiles into this machine.

If you are using Google Colab then you need to ensure that you are using Python 2:

Before we start - we have to use Python2 (not Python 3), so we should choose this as an option in "Runtime" -> "Change Runtime Type" at the top or create a new notebook in Python2 by appending "&runtime=python2" to the URL.

#Colab only
#we are going to make a directory called APPS
!mkdir -p APPS
#Now we move to our directory called APPS and we download ROOT from the CERN server, this version is chosen because it runs on this machine - if you want to run this locally check the versions!
!cd APPS && wget https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v6.13.08.Linux-ubuntu18-x86_64-gcc7.3.tar.gz 
#Now we extract our downloaded file:
!cd APPS && tar -xf root_v6.13.08.Linux-ubuntu18-x86_64-gcc7.3.tar.gz

#Colab only:
#now we can extract some files from ROOT and ensure that we can access the libraries. We use some python key words to get access to the right files:

"""#Why are we here?

This week is about finding out something about one of the fundemental questions in physics. Why do we have "stuff".

According to many of our models, and according to many measurements in particle physics, matter and anti-matter appear to be produced in equal quantities.

However, when one looks at the Universe in general, we have more matter than anti-matter left - so there need to be some processes where anti-matter and matter are not produced equally. You can find out more about the Matter/Anti-Matter Asymmetry [here](http://press.web.cern.ch/backgrounders/matterantimatter-asymmetry)

One place we look for this asymetry is in [charge-partity (CP) violation](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/october-2005/explain-it-in-60-seconds) in particle physics processes. This essentially says that the processes that happen in the anti-particle version of a decay do not **exactly** match to the processes that happen in the particle version of the decay.



---



At LHCb, we produce both particle of the  B<sup>+</sup> meson and it's antiparticle the B<sup>-</sup> meson.

We cannot detect these mesons directly. They decay into other things before we have a chance to measure them properly. So we collect data on the decay products, often called daughter particles. There are 524 [documented](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/listings/rpp2014-list-B-plus-minus.pdf) ways that the B<sup>+/-</sup> decays into various combinations. In order to simplify the process, we choose decay combinations that are convenient or have particular properties.

In this analysis, we will take the process:-

B<sup>+</sup>->K<sup>+</sup> + K<sup>+</sup>  + K<sup>-</sup>

or

B<sup>-</sup>->K<sup>-</sup> + K<sup>-</sup>  + K<sup>+</sup>


To do so, we are given the following data for each event in our system:-

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhcb/opendata-project/80d64a3796e593fc8f9b257e85f32ae2e54f131f/Images/Variables.png)

Here, H1 is the detected daughter particle (so a Kaon or a Pion), **not** the B-meson - the mother particle. Normally we would have to do some reconstruction from the decay products (the Daughters) to the Mother to be able to make some conclusions.

Let's get started with working with this data:

For our analysis, the momentum of each of the daughter particles is split into the three cartesian components. We have combined these into a variable called H1_Ptot

Having discovered all of the relevant information about our daughter particles, we need to combine the measurements about them into a single mother - which will be our B<sup>+</sup> or our B<sup>-</sup>

Having found our momentum and energy, we can use these quantities to find our experimental mass (not the theoretical mass as we have used for the reconstruction).

When we calculate this, we will get a distribution of masses. This is due to errors in the measurements made either by the detector, or in the experiment itself. We hope to have a reasonably narrow peak to work with, but, sometimes this is not possible.

Additionally there will be other particles in the detector - which means our daughters might have come from two or even three different processes. Events which don't come from the same process will give a higher or lower mass than we are looking for. This is typically called the *background* while events which come from our event of interest are called the *signal*

"""Does this match what we would expect from theory?
- The theoretical mass for B+ is 5279 MeV/c^2. In the plot, there is a peak between 5000 and 5500. This seems to match our expectations of the mass.

We know that some of our particles are the B+ and some are the B- particle. There will also be some particles in our system that are not coming from a genuine B+/- or are a B+/- but are not constructed from Kaons.

We have some tools available to help:-

  *  During detection, software attributes the probability of a particle being a Kaon or a Pion (in the H1_ProbK or H1_ProbPi variable)
  * The detector also knows if the particle was a Muon - since it has detectors specifically for these. So it can attribute a 0 or a 1 to this probability
  * The reconstructed vertex has a some kind of quality associated with it (we call this the Vertex χ2 (this is the variable B_VertexChi2). This is the statistical measure that determines how well we found a single point to be the source of all three particles.

In order to get a better result, we should select our data to have the properties we desire and make some rules (often called a selection) to cut away data we don't want to include for various reasons. e.g. we know we don't have any muons in our decay - so any time H1/H2/H3 are a muon they should be excluded. The other variables are not so clear - so we can plot them to make a decision.

"""The post-cut graph peak appears smaller than the pre-cut. This means that most of the recorded particles were not kaons but pions.

#How do we count the number of events?

We now have a histogram of events that we have reconstructed as a B meson. But some of these events are caused by a co-incidence of events which would still occur if there were no B mesons actually produced. We call this the background. Background and signal are indistinguishable now as the detector cannot tell the difference and our cuts were unable to remove the events for physics reasons. We can do some statistical analysis, if we know the approximate shapes of our signal and our background. Just like a least-squares fitting we can run a fit routine to minimise the error between the fitted curve and our data. As an example, if we know our data has an exponential background and a gaussian signal:

![Gaussian+Exp Background](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/RooStats/RooStatsTutorialsJune2013/GausExpModelFit.png)

Here the red line represents our signal, the blue dotted line is our background and the solid blue line is our combined curve. The graph also shows the number of signal events and the number of background events. The signal now is a tiny fraction of the total data shown in the plot.

In order to do this, we need to build a fit model, around which the software can try to fit our data.

We use RooFit for this, which includes:
* Gaussian
* Exponential
* Chebychev
* Crystal Ball
* Breit-Wigner

As well as several other choices.

Typically exponential and Chebychev functions are used for background and Gaussian, Crystal Ball and Breit-Wigner are used for signal. We can also combine them (e.g. 1 crystal ball, 1 gaussian, 1 exponential) in various ways.

"""#Counting

So we have now loaded our data; we have reconstructed information about the mother B meson and we have cut away any data which looks like it might not be what we are looking for. We have then plotted histograms of the mass of the B meson and used this to fit a model, a function to describe the events there. We now have to identify which of our events belong to the B<sup>+</sup> and how many of them belong to B<sup>-</sup>.

To do this, should split out data into two groups (and throw away data which doesn't comply with either decay)

We will be looking for the events which are


B<sup>+</sup>->K<sup>+</sup> + K<sup>+</sup>  + K<sup>-</sup>

or

B<sup>-</sup>->K<sup>-</sup> + K<sup>-</sup>  + K<sup>+</sup>

We can look for the number of positive and negative charges in H1, H2 and H3 (using the variable ```H1_Charge``` etc.). If we have 0 or 3 positive charges, we should throw the event away and if we have 1 it should be assigned be a B<sup>-</sup>, with 2 it should be a B<sup>+</sup>

Once we have defined if it's a B<sup>+</sup> or a B <sup>-</sup>, we should go ahead and ensure the pre-selection is applied and then plot our B mass, and fit the model to find the yield.

We can then calculate the assymetry from this equation:

$A=\frac{(N^{B-}-N^{B+})}{(N^{B-}+N^{B+})}$

Where N<sup>B+/- </sup> is the number of events found from the fitted yield of the signal from each data set.

The uncertainty on this result is given by:

$\sigma_A=\sqrt\frac{1-A^2}{N^{B-}+N^{B+}}$

Calculate these two values for your data and print them below:

You just made your first LHCb physics analysis. Does this seem like a reasonable result? Did we explain why we have an excess of mass in the Universe?

## **Bonus content only below here:**

To make a further anaysis, we can look into the intermediate processes.

We have so far considered only that the B meson ultimately decays into three kaons. It may be that on the way, the B meson first decays into a Kaon and another particle, and then from that particle to two Kaons.

We would expect this to be one of three possible modes (for B<sup>+</sup>):

$R^{++} \rightarrow K_1^+ +K_2^+$

(we don't expect this to happen because of the like charges in the Kaons)

$R^0 \rightarrow K_1^+ +K_3^-$

$R^0 \rightarrow K_2^+ +K_3^-$

(Expect symmetric arrangements for B<sup>-</sup>)

To analyse the intermediate states we can measure the invarient masses of the intermediate states and then plot them on what is called a Dalitz plot (this is a 2D plot with two different two body decays (from the three body decay) on each axis)

#Define a function to find the invarient mass of two given Kaons

#Then, ensuring you're still taking the data after the selection, make a Dalitz plot. This is a 2-D scatter plot (use e.g. TH2F to make the plot where we used TH1F before)
#Choose an appropriate binning in your scatter

"""We can further improve our plot, since two sets of particles on each axis are exactly the same (one positive Kaon, one negative Kaon). So we can plot the maximum of the two values on one axis and the minimum on the other. We can use a quick numpy check and then plot those values."""

#Make the revised Dalitz plot here for B+ mesons

#Make the revised Dalitz plot here for B- mesons

#Where we have a higher density of points (or a bigger value in the bin) this is indication of an intermediate resonance
